#### Statistics Dashboard:
- **4 Interactive Statistics Cards:**
  1. Active Today (Green) - Shows medications due today
  2. Total Medications (Blue) - All medications in system
  3. Completed (Purple) - Finished medication courses
  4. Upcoming (Amber) - Future medication schedules

#### Interactive Features:
- Tap any date to view detailed medication information

### 2. Calendar Helper Functions (`utils/calendarHelpers.js`)

Created comprehensive utility library with 15 functions:

#### Date Management:
- `generateDateRange()` - Generate array of dates for a period
- `isToday()` - Check if date is today
- `isPastDate()` - Check if date is in past
- `isFutureDate()` - Check if date is in future

### 3. Updated Calendar Screen (`app/(drawer)/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`)

- Removed unnecessary props
- Streamlined component integration
- Calendar component now self-contained

### 4. Documentation

Created 3 comprehensive documentation files:

#### `docs/CALENDAR_ENHANCEMENT.md` (Technical Documentation)
- Detailed technical implementation guide
- Data flow diagrams
- Code examples and structure
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance optimization notes
- Testing recommendations
- Future enhancement ideas

#### `docs/CALENDAR_SUMMARY.md` (User-Facing Documentation)
- Feature overview
- Use cases and workflows
- Visual design specifications
- Color palette reference
- Accessibility notes
- Testing checklist
- Contributing guidelines

#### `README.md` (Updated)
- Added calendar features section

- Improved feature organization
- Better visual hierarchy

## 📊 Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations:
- `useMemo` for markedDates calculation (only recalculates when medicines, selected date, or theme change)
- `useMemo` for selectedDateMedications filtering
- `useMemo` for medicationStats computation
- Efficient date range generation with minimal iterations
- Proper React key usage for list rendering

### Data Flow:
```
Zustand Store (medicines)
    ↓
CalendarComponent
    ↓
├── Statistics Cards (medicationStats)
├── Calendar (markedDates)
├── Legend (static)
└── Date Details (selectedDateMedications)
```

### State Management:
- Single `selected` state for date selection
- All other data derived from Zustand store
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Proper context usage for theming

### Component Structure:
```jsx
<ScrollView>
  <View> {/* Main Container */}
    <Calendar /> {/* react-native-calendars */}
    
    {medicines.length > 0 && (
      <View> {/* Statistics Cards */}
        <StatCard /> × 4
      </View>
    )}
    
    <View> {/* Legend Section */}
      <LegendItems />
    </View>
    
    {selected && medications.length > 0 && (
      <View> {/* Selected Date Details */}
        <MedicationCard /> × N
      </View>
    )}
    
    {selected && medications.length === 0 && (
      <View> {/* Empty State */}
        <EmptyMessage />
      </View>
    )}
  </View>
</ScrollView>
```
